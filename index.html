   <div class="Salcido">
       <h2 class="laxers">Sergio Salcido</h2>
    <p>Coming off an amazing collegiate record at Syracuse, Salcido has proven himself to be a menace to any defender foolish enough to challenge him on the field. </p>

<div class="Pannell">   
<h2 class="laxers">Rob Pannell</h2>
<p>An OG laxer, Pannell's playing will never cease to excite even the least interested person. Despite being one of the shortest players in the league, he has continually used his diminutive figure to his advantage, dodging and weaving past defenders with ease. </p>

<h2 class="laxers">Paul Rabil</h2>
<p>Unmistakably the most well know lacrosse player in the world, Paul Rabil has changed the way lacrosse exists. After forming the PLL in 2018-2019 and promising to pay players better than the MLL, Rabil has maintained his status as a powerful and dominating player in the lacrosse world. </p>

<div class="Baptiste">
<h2 class="laxers">Trevor Baptiste</h2>
<p>The man, the myth, the legend. Trevor Baptiste is undoubtedly the greatest faceoff player ever to grace the game of lacrosse. His strength and speed make it close to impossible to beat him at the faceoff, pushing him to be a valuable asset to any team. </p>
